# Smart-Insole-System-DAQ
Integrated PCB board design for Data Acquisition (DAQ) of a smart insole system aiming to measure the plantar pressure distribution during walking

Tha function of the PCB board is to read the signals from pressure sensor array integrated inside the insole, then store the data and transfer it to the phone by bluetooth.

I am very happy that the PCB board was manufactured and tested on some basic function.
